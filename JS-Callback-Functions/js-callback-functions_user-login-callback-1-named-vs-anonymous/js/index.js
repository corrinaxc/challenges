console.clear();

function handleUserLogin(onSuccess) {
  // You might wonder why this function is called `onSuccess`. This will become clear by the fourth challenge! 🤞
  onSuccess();
}

function showWelcomeMessage () {
  console.log("Welcome! You are logged in now.");
}

handleUserLogin(showWelcomeMessage);

// Call handleUserLogin below!

/*
You should write a callback function in two different ways.
In both cases your callback function should log the following text to the console:
"Welcome! You are logged in now."

1. Write a function with the "function" keyword named "showWelcomeMessage" which logs the desired text. Then
   call the higher order function "handleUserLogin" and pass your callback function "showWelcomeMessage" as the first argument.*/
